# Galaxy Rotation Curves

## Overview
A project comparing the predictions of Newtonian Mechanics with measurements of rotation curves of the M31 (Andromeda) and Milky Way Galaxy. We consider two different sources of uncertainty, and compare the consistency of the predictions and measurements under the different uncertainties.

## M-H MCMC sampler 
This code implements the Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and generates a plot visualizing the sampled data against the true density function (here, gaussian).

I worked by myself.
