# Galaxy Rotation Curves

## Overview
A project comparing the predictions of Newtonian Mechanics with measurements of rotation curves of the M31 (Andromeda) and Milky Way Galaxy. We consider two different sources of uncertainty, and compare the consistency of the predictions and measurements under the different uncertainties.

I worked by myself.
