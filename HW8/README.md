This README consists of two parts. 
Part 1: A good and 'bad' plot found on arXiv, based on tufte's rules and class discussion. 
Part 2: A plot from a past homework of mine, improved, and explained.

Figure 1: A good plot. 

!['bad' plot](dsps_badplot.png)
Figure 2: A 'bad' plot. The plot attempts to demonstrate the effect of population size on computational efficiency for a particular algorithm. I chose this plot because the unjustified use of 3D distorts the graphic and makes it hard to comprehend. a 2D plot would enhance clarity, allow for a more accurate comparison across different conditions.
