This README consists of two parts. 
Part 1: A good and 'bad' plot found on arXiv, based on tufte's rules and class discussion. 
Part 2: A plot from a past homework of mine, improved, and explained.

## Part 1
![good plot](dsps_goodplot.png)

Figure 1: A good plot, showing good use of 3D and colors. The coloring is arguably redundant with the z-axis / 3d, but helps to visualize the 3d structure nonetheless.

!['bad' plot](dsps_badplot.png)
Figure 2: A 'bad' plot. The plot attempts to demonstrate the effect of population size on computational efficiency for a particular algorithm. I chose this plot because the unjustified use of 3D distorts the graphic and makes it hard to comprehend. a 2D plot would enhance clarity, allow for a more accurate comparison across different conditions.
