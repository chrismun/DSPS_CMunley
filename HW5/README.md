## Bayesian Methods for GRB Afterglow Modeling

This project is centered around implementing Bayesian methods to model the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglow using a broken power law model. Fits are made using  linear regression with a training-test split using scikit-learn, implementing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter optimization for the GRB afterglow broken power law model, and evaluating the models' performance using log likelihood ratio, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The aim is to enhance understanding of Bayesian methods and their application in astrophysical phenomena modeling.

I worked with Jose Falla and Bivek Pokhrel. We worked together on some parts, but I was involved in every step.
