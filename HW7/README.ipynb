This Google Colab notebook is designed for the analysis of kidney microarray data, focusing on the classification and differential expression of three renal cell cancer (RCC) subtypes: clear cell (cc), papillary (p), and chromophobe (ch). Our aim is to apply and evaluate various clustering algorithms, including t-SNE, UMAP, K-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering, to dissect the gene expression data. The notebook will document the methodology, parameter selection, and comparative analysis of clustering outcomes against the backdrop of high-dimensional biological data.

I worked by myself.
