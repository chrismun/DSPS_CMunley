## Overview: Exploring Key Statistical and Physical Distributions

### Notebook 1: Insight into the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The CLT is a statistical theory stating that given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the population’s distribution.

#### Highlights:
- **Sampling Across Distributions:** Samples from five distributions (Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Chi-Squared, and a fifth choice) were generated and explored.
- **Visual Analysis:** Sample means and sizes (N) were plotted to depict the CLT visually, followed by a histogram showcasing the distribution of sample means.
- **Gaussian Fitting:** A Gaussian was fitted to the means’ distribution, confirming the CLT.

### Notebook 2: Diving into the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

The Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution provides insights into the speed distribution of particles in a thermally equilibrated system, elucidating the statistical mechanics governing particle behavior.

#### Noteworthy Points:
- **Deriving and Understanding:** Explanation and visual representation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution.
- **Visual Interpretation:** Illustrated how the distribution varies with differing temperatures and particle speeds.

### Usage Note:
Ensure necessary Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy) are installed to utilize the notebooks.
